- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chenyubi14
- ðŸ‘€ My expertise are VASP, shell, python. I mainly work on first-principles calculations, espectially phonon, thermal transport, defect calculations, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Vasptools contains general functions like density of state calculations, wavefunction output, and also specific functions that is useful only if you have the same need as me.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: post an issue on github. I don't want to get emails.

chenyubi14/chenyubi14 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I post every function I developted, but they are sometimes one-time used. I am tired of deleting them, so you may ignore the extra functions. I am also too lazy to write README for every function I wrote. I will do it at request by Wechat/email/Slack.

I recommend download the scripts in a single folder, so add `export SCRIPT=/path/to/scripts` in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile files.

# VASP inputs
I have a special INCAR format. You may look at INCAR_template for an example. The fixed INCAR format has several benefits: 

(1) You can directly `diff path1/INCAR path2/INCAR` in terminal to see the difference of two jobs.

(2) You will have a way to edit INCAR easily, as provided by my code.

If you want to make your own template, it is very easy. Just edit INCAR_template, and run `python incar_generate.py`, so the file class0_incar.py, which stores INCAR tags with comments, will be updated with new formats. Remember to not use `=` randomly, because incar_generate.py uses `=` to identify a tag.

# frequently used functions and commands

`python $SCRIPT/op_bs_dos.py` for submit a job to calculate density of states
`python $SCRIPT/draw_dos1_element.py` can plot the density of state plot
`python $SCRIPT/update_edit_incar.py` can update the INCAR file to the newest format
`python $SCRIPT/update_edit_incar.py mode`: please read the file itself. It contains many modes to fit in different situations. 
For example, if you want to change one tag for many directories. Create a mode in the update_edit_incar.py file, and run this command.

# usage for specific functions
## defect
`python $SCRIPT/draw_KS1_insideBG.py` draws the Kohn-Sham(KS) states within band gap. It is ususally useful to plot defect KS states.
## phonon

## electronic structure by Boltztrap


# file types
class*.py (files starting with class): module files to be imported/used in other files

  class0_functions1,2,3.py: small functions

  class1_read.py: a class to read VASP input and output

  class2_update_input.py: a class of editting VASP input files

  class3_smaller_folder.py: a class dealing with op_*.py files, it usually generate subdirectories for operations like density of state calculations

  class95_energyf_fromTL.py: plot formation energy from transition levels, usualy from others' calculated transition levels

  class96_formationenergy.py: plot formation energy diagram from own computed jobs

  class99_last_drawmulinfo.py: a class stored information for drawing graphs

  class0_incar.py: a function write INCAR file with detailed comments.


op*.py (files starting with op): often used to create a subdirectory for some functions

  op_bs_dos.py: density of states (dos) calculations. Assume the current directory has a self-consistent output WAVECAR and CHGCAR, create a subdirectory called "dos_non-self", edit the INCAR in "dos_non-self" for dos calculations.


out*.py (files starting with out): generate useful information from VASP output file

  out_draw.py: draw data. Rotate over many folders to read data, and then get the plot information.

  out_formH.py: output the formation enthalpy for a single folder

  out_table_band.py: generate a latex table with bandgap information


draw*.py: rigorously these files should belong to out*.py, but draw*.py are too many, so I decided to have a new starting string. draw*.py have to draw a diagram, and out*.py has some ouputs other than a diagram.


energyf*.py: plot formation energy diagrams. Please refer to another repository (chenyubi14/easy_defect_formation_energy). It should be contained in draw_ files, but it may contain too many different materials -> a separate file format might be neater.
