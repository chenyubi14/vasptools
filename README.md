- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chenyubi14
- ðŸ‘€ My expertise are VASP, shell, python. I mainly work on first-principles calculations, espectially phonon, thermal transport, defect calculations, etc.
- ðŸŒ± You may find jobkit useful because it provides my tips for running jobs smoothly. The vasptools is useful only if you use VASP.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: post an issue on github. I don't want to get emails.
