#  (Re)start parameters:
# ISTART=1	# read WAVECAR?: 0-no begin from scratch, 1-yes restart with ionstant energy cutoff and Orbitals are read from WAVECAR, 2-yes constant basis, Use 0 (if no WAVECAR) or 1 (If have WAVECAR to save time)
# ICHARG=1	# how VASP constructs the initial charge density. Read CHGCAR?: 2-no if ISTART=0 (superpositions of atomic charge densities), 0-no (Calculate charge density from initial wave function in WAVECAR), 1-yes,read and extropolate from old positions (on CHGCAR) to new positions using linear combination of charge densities, self-consistent calculations, 11-yes, non-self-consisitent calculations. Charge density will be kept constant during the whole electronic minimization. To obtain the eigenvalues (for band structure plots) or the DOS for a given charge density read from CHGCAR. The selfconsistent CHGCAR file must be determined beforehand doing by a fully self-consistent calculation with a k-point grid spanning the entire Brillouin zone.

# Zero field splitting
# LDMATRIX=True # Will give D matrix: Spin-spin contribution to zero-field splitting tensor (MHz). not documented anywhere

# Hyperfine parameter
# LHYPERFINE = .TRUE. #  compute the hyperfine tensors at the atomic sites. The total Fermi contact term is given by Atot. Beware: for the moment we have chosen NOT to include the core contributions A1c in Atot. If you so want, you should add them by hand to Atot.
# NGYROMAG = gamma_1  gamma_2 ... gamma_N # specify nuclear gyromagnetic ratios. Need to read which nuclear isotope is used in experiment, use the gamma for that isotope. Specify one number for each of the N species on the POSCAR file. If not set NGYROMAG in the INCAR file, VASP assumes a factor of 1 for each species.

#  Magnetic (Non-collinear) calculaton:
# ISPIN=1	# Magnetism: 1 nonmagnetic, 2 magnetic and PROCAR contains a second set of projections for the spin down channel.
# MAGMOM=2	# -5 5 -5 5 -5 5 -5 5 -5 5 -5 18*0;   initial magnetic moment ( for noncollinear three componens of magnetic moment)for each atom (order as in POSCAR);

# dielectric constant calculation: # PEAD (Perturbation Expression After Discretization): determine the ground state of an insulating system under the application of a finite homogeneous electric field
# LPEAD=.False.	#As an alternative to solving a linear Sternheimer equation (one method to calculate displacements, I think), one may compute the derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals w.r.t. k  from finite differences by specifying LPEAD=.TRUE.
# LEPSILON=.TRUE.	# determines the static matrix, does not support HSE
# LOPTICS=.TRUE.	# computes frequency dependent dielectric matrix after the ground state has been determined
# CSHIFT=0.1	# CSHIFT=0.1 by default in linear response calculations, and otherwise in GW. CSHIFT sets the (small) complex shift Î· in the Kramers-Kronig transformation. If the gap is very small (i.e. approaching two times CSHIFT), slight inaccuracies in the static dielectric constant are possible, which can be remedied by decreasing CSHIFT. If CSHIFT is further decreased, it is strongly recommended to increase the parameter NEDOS to values around 2000.
# LCALCEPS=.TRUE.	# the macroscopic ion-clamped static dielectric tensor, Born effective charge tensors, and the ion-clamped piezoelectric tensor of the system are determined from the reponse to finite electric fields

# Constrained occupation calculation: #set ISMEAR:-2 
# FERWE=300*1.0 1*1.0 1*1.0 1*1.0 999*0.0	# FERWE sets the occupancies of the states in the up-spin channel.the left number is the number of states to be filled with the right number which is the occupation, so in both spin up and spin down, we fill the first 300 bands with 1 electron (the valence band).. in spin up, we then fill the next 3 states with 1 electron each, in spin down, we only put one electron in the middle state (corresponding to lifting the one down electron up one level).. then we have 999 empty bands (the conduction band) #300 is probably not the right number, you should figure this out from your EIGENVAL file, 999 is probably also not right, but VASP does not care if there are more empty bands than are necessary
# FERDO=300*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 1*0.0 999*0.0	# FERDO sets the occupancies of the states in the down-spin channel for ISMEAR:-2 and ISPIN:2. Start by using ALGO: Normal, if this fails, try ALGO: All, if this fails, try ALGO: Damped,
